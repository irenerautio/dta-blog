        <p>I was born in -93 and have always shown interest in <b>drawing and video games</b>. After high school in -12 I got into vocational school to study <b>audiovisual media</b> concentrating in 3D. After graduating due to my poor internship I didn't want to work in the field anymore. My school also didn't ready the students for the work life and I was alone and depressed.</p> 
        
        <p>Not knowing what I wanted to do with my life I ended up working in McDonald's (let's just leave it at that) for three years. I got into a school to learn massaging and after graduating I came into the conclusion that life of an entrepreneur is not for me. Again, lost in my life, depressed and sad I headed to <b>Ohjaamo</b> in Helsinki. I asked for help to get work with my media education since it is sadly a little outdated. From there I found my way to <b>Digitalents Academy</b> where I can learn coding which, added to my graphic sense and skills in drawing, opens new paths for me in employment.</p>
       
        <p>Why am I telling all this in my blog? Because simply; life is not that easy and I want people, who may be struggling with depression and insecurity, to know that they are not alone. It should be acceptable to feel unsure about what you want to do in life. It's never too late to get back on the horse or start something completely new.</p>
